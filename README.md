# proxy-checker
Simple multithreaded proxy checker. Takes several text files as inputs. All other information is in README.md.
Autor: NikASGiG.
The script looks for all .txt files in directory named "data", takes all the proxies out, checks them and then puts the result to the file named "proxys1_good". The input format is "ip:port" (e.g., "127.0.0.1:8080").
Have a good use.
